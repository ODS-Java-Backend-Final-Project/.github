# 🎲  Board Game Meetup Backend - Board Game Microservices Application

## 📝 Project Description

**GameMeetUp** is a microservices-based application that allows users to explore a collection of board games and link them to social events based on their interests. The goal of the platform is to connect people with board games tailored to their mood, group size, theme preferences, or environment, and to facilitate event planning around those games.

The application includes:
- Management of board games.
- Creation and management of events tied to specific games.
- Cross-service communication using OpenFeign to associate games with events.
- Service discovery with Eureka and centralized routing through an API Gateway.

```

Uses Feign Client to fetch board game details

- **board-game-service**: Handles CRUD operations for board games.
- **event-service**: Manages event creation and association with games.
- **discovery-service**: Eureka Server for dynamic service registration and discovery.
- **api-gateway**: Centralized entry point for routing API requests.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions for Local Development

### 1. Clone the Repositories you can find in this organization, for example the event-service:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ODS-Java-Backend-Final-Project/event-service.git
cd event-service
```

### 2. Run MySQL Database

Make sure you have a MySQL instance running on port 3306

### 3. Configuration & Ports
Service	Port	Description
```
| Service            | Port | Description              |
|--------------------|------|--------------------------|
| discovery-service  | 8761 | Eureka Server            |
| api-gateway        | 8080 | API Gateway (entry point)|
| board-game-service | 8081 | Board game CRUD          |
| event-service      | 8082 | Event CRUD               |
```
Sample application.properties:
``` 
spring.application.name=event-service
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/event_service
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=admin
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
server.port=8082
```
### 4. Build and Run the Application

From the root directory:

```mvn clean install ```

Then start each service individually:
```
cd discovery-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd api-gateway && mvn spring-boot:run
cd board-game-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd event-service && mvn spring-boot:run
```
